# Firebase functions plugin for AdminJS

This is an official [AdminJS](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/adminjs) plugin which allows you to run AdminJS on [Firebase Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions)

## AdminJS

AdminJS is an automatic admin interface which can be plugged into your application. You, as a developer, provide database models (like posts, comments, stores, products or whatever else your application uses), and AdminJS generates UI which allows you (or other trusted users) to manage content.

Check out the example application here: https://adminjs-demo.herokuapp.com/admin/

Or visit [AdminJS](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/adminjs) github page.

## Usage

To see example usage visit the [firebase functions section under AdminJS project page](https://softwarebrothers.github.io/adminjs-dev/module-adminjs-firebase-functions.html)
